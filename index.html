			<h3>A Project by Lulu Becker</h3>
			<p><b>Block of Code</b> is a project based off of a conversation between Lulu and Sean - and has grown from there.</p>
			<p>The topic was esentially regarding blocks of code - and if Lulu were a webpage, this would be it!</p>
			<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<p>"She had a passionate longing for the garden, the darkness, the pure sky, the stars."</p>
				<h4>Anton Chekhov, “After the Theatre” (via
					<u>wordsnquotes</u>)</h4>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<h4>
					<u>kawaiigod</u>:</h4>
				<p>if i get rich my mom gettin paid first thing</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and,
					in fact, it is nobody’s business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves
					and our neighbors worthy if anything can."</p>
				<h4>Thomas Merton (via
					<u>breanna-lynn</u>)</h4>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<h4>
					<u>mujeringrata</u>:</h4>
				<p>i want a soft love that feels like when ur standing in the sunlight and u don’t want to leave - that gives u the sensation
					of lazily melting into what’s around u as u take it all in</p>

					<p>i wonder if magic is real, but only in a really mundane way.</p>
					<p>when i was little i could almost inerringly switch back to disney channel right as the ads ended when i was channel
						surfing.
					</p>
					<p>maybe youve never accidentally crushed a ladybug underfoot. maybe your microwave popcorn never burns. maybe you can
						spin around lots and lots of times before you get dizzy.</p>
					<p>is that magic??</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h4>
					<u>akai-kaede</u>:</h4>
				<p>honestly im not sure if these are magic or just small, invisible skills. im not sure which i like better.</p>
				<p>My ankles never twist. I’ve always been rather active, I did track for five years (all the running events), and one time
					while running I stepped in a hole, lost my shoe, and landed sprawling about five feet away. I pulled my shoe on and
					kept running.</p>
				<p>I have a coworker who somehow makes better coffee than everyone else even though the grounds come pre-measured and all
					you have to do is load them up and push a button. I have a friend who has inch long nails that never break. My brother
					can copy origami just by looking at the finished product and my mother can do the same with knots. I knew a guy who
					never made an error when typing.</p>
				<p>Maybe we all have little magics, the kind that you don’t realize you have. Just tiny things that make your life slightly
					better but are completely unnoticed on the outside.</p>
